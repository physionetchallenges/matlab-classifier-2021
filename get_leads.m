function [leads, leads_idx]= get_leads(header_data, num_leads)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Purpose:
% Extract the available ECG leads
% 1. 12 leads are available or
% 2. 6 leads are available: I, II, III, aVR, aVL & aVF or
% 3. 3 leads are avialable: I, II & V2 or
% 4. 2 leads are avialable: I & V5

% Inputs:
% 1. Header files and the number of leads 
%
% Outputs:
% leads: available leads names
% leads_idx: The index of available leads
