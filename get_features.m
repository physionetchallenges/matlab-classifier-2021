%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Purpose: Extract features from ECG signals of every lead
% Inputs:
% 1. ECG data from available leads (data)
% 2. Header files including the number of leads (header_data)
% 3. The available leads index (in data/header file)
%
% Outputs:
% features for every ECG lead:
% 1. Age 2. Sex 3. root square mean (RSM) of the ECG leads
